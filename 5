1. Write a SQL query which sets the "Active" flag of the FHLB Borrowing account to "1" from dbo.Accounts table:

Solution : 
We use [UPDATE] dbo.Accounts
Then we use [SET] Active = 1
And the final step is to select [WHERE] AccountName = 'FHLB Borrowing';


2. Write a SQL query which joins both tables dbo.Accounts and dbo.AccountType and shows the AccountName and AccountType of all records

Solution : 
We use [SELECT] to join A.AccountName and AT.AccountType.
Then we select [FROM] dbo.Accounts A.
And the final step is to use [JOIN] dbo.AccountType AT ON A.ID = AT.AccountID;
